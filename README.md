Description:
==

The goal of this project is to build a website where users can create and manage their own calandar. the goal is to provide a tool that combine the features from doodle and a standard calendar (ie: Google calendar). Users can create items (like a normal calendar), but additionally a user can invite other people to an item. Users can upload files (ie: pdf files, images) to an item, either private (only uploader has access) or shared (alle users that are sharing an item have access).
Managing new accounts is always considered as a boring task. We do hope to integrate our web-service with the applications already available on the market (g+, Facebook, etc). Finally, as being a proof of concept for a course, our project targets the latest technologies/devices.
